"""
Use this rule to set a limit to lines length.

.. rubric:: Options

* ``max`` defines the maximal (inclusive) length of lines.
* ``allow-non-breakable-words`` is used to allow non breakable words (without
  spaces inside) to overflow the limit. This is useful for long URLs, for
  instance. Use ``yes`` to allow, ``no`` to forbid.

.. rubric:: Examples

#. With ``line-length: {max: 70}``

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    long sentence:
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do
      eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

   the following code snippet would **FAIL**:
   ::

    long sentence:
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
      tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

#. With ``line-length: {max: 60, allow-non-breakable-words: yes}``

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    this:
      is:
        - a:
            http://localhost/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/long/url

    # this comment is too long,
    # but hard to split:
    # http://localhost/another/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/long/url

   the following code snippet would **FAIL**:
   ::

    - this line is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long but could be easily splitted...

#. With ``line-length: {max: 60, allow-non-breakable-words: no}``

   the following code snippet would **FAIL**:
   ::

    this:
      is:
        - a:
            http://localhost/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/long/url
