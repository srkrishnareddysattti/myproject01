Use this rule to control the number of spaces inside braces (``{`` and ``}``).

.. rubric:: Options

* ``min-spaces-inside`` defines the minimal number of spaces required inside
  braces.
* ``max-spaces-inside`` defines the maximal number of spaces allowed inside
  braces.

.. rubric:: Examples

#. With ``braces: {min-spaces-inside: 0, max-spaces-inside: 0}``

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    object: {key1: 4, key2: 8}

   the following code snippet would **FAIL**:
   ::

    object: { key1: 4, key2: 8 }

#. With ``braces: {min-spaces-inside: 1, max-spaces-inside: 3}``

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    object: { key1: 4, key2: 8 }

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    object: { key1: 4, key2: 8   }

   the following code snippet would **FAIL**:
